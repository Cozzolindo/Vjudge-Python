# 🧠 Vjudge Python Solutions

Welcome to the **Vjudge-Python** repository!  
This repository contains my accepted solutions for various algorithmic problems hosted on [Vjudge](https://vjudge.net/), implemented using Python. Each file corresponds to a specific problem, and all solutions have successfully passed the Vjudge test cases.

## 📌 About the Repository

- Each Python script is named after its corresponding Vjudge problem.
- Solutions are structured to be clean, readable, and optimized.
- The repository is regularly updated as I solve more problems on the platform.

## 💡 Technologies & Concepts

- **Language**: Python 3
- **Topics Covered**:  
  - Data Structures (arrays, stacks, queues, hash maps)  
  - Graph Algorithms (BFS, DFS, Dijkstra)  
  - Dynamic Programming  
  - Greedy Algorithms  
  - Sorting and Searching  
  - Recursion and Backtracking  
  - String Manipulation  
  - Mathematics and Number Theory

> ✅ All files passed the test cases on Vjudge and are verified correct.

## 🚀 Getting Started

You can run any of the solutions locally using Python 3:

```bash
python3 filename.py
```

Some problems require input from `stdin`. If so, redirect from a file or use manual input.

## 🤝 Contributing

This repository is a personal archive of solved problems. However, feel free to fork the repo, suggest improvements, or even challenge the logic if you spot an optimization!
